# STOPWATCH
This stopwatch project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to start, pause, reset, and track time with precision in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds. The design is clean and responsive, making it easy to use while demonstrating core web development and DOM manipulation skills.

Features
Start, Stop, and Reset buttons – control the stopwatch easily.
Time Display – shows hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.
Accurate Timing – uses JavaScript’s setInterval for real-time updates.
Clear & Simple Layout – designed with CSS for a user-friendly interface.
Responsive Design – works properly on both desktop and mobile.

HTML (Structure):
Learned how to design the basic layout of the stopwatch with buttons and a display.
Understood how to use IDs and classes to connect HTML with CSS and JavaScript.

CSS (Design):
Styled the stopwatch to make it user-friendly and visually appealing.
Learned how to align elements properly and apply responsive design for different screen sizes.

JavaScript (Functionality):
Gained knowledge about timers (setInterval and clearInterval) to start, stop, and reset the stopwatch.
Learned how to updatE the display in real-time using DOM manipulation.
Understood how to handle different states (running, paused, reset).

Project Skills:
Improved logical thinking by breaking down the stopwatch into smaller functions.
Learned to debug and fix errors while testing the code.
Understood the importance of combining structure, design, and interactivity.
